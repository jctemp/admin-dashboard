# Admin Dashboard

This [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) was about the re-creation of an admin dashboard.
A design was provided to follow the design, which one should create using `grid` and `flex` as all the other tools learned during the `css` lessons.
They suggested differing from the original design as the layout was the goal.
More, the layout is not required to be responsive.

## Lessons learned

This task was a difficult one.
Creating the layout is not difficult.
However, the challenging part was to keep things simple and not over-engineer the `css`.
I tried to alter the design, which was quite demanding because of the added layer of complexity in thinking about fitting colours, content and accessibility.
